This repository contains the source code of a [FTD Hands-On Workshop
(Beta)](https://www.fifthtry.com/events/).

> FTD language is a possible replacement for JavaScript/React to build web
> front-ends. In this workshop you will learn the basics of FTD and build a web
> app that talks to existing web services. We will build an application for
> managing to-do lists from scratch.
>
> Basic knowledge of HTTP API is needed, but no prior knowledge of front-end is
> required.
>
> The workshop is taught by the creators of FTD, and you will learn about the
> motivation and design decisions that shaped FTD as well.
>
> In this hands-on workshop we will go through a series of exercises in stages
> and write code to get the application working. Participants are required to
> have a decent computer, but there is no need to install any software before
> hand (other than your favorite editor).

This workshop is a 3 part workshop, where in each part we will learn a different
aspect of programming with FTD. In first two parts we will interact with HTTP API
and create side data driven server rendered pages. In the third part we will
create client side event handling and interact with HTTP APIs (ajax and form
submissions).

## Basic Instruction

Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ftd-lang/ftd-workshop.git`.

Get on the [discord channel for this workshop](https://discord.gg/d2MgKBybEQ)
and interact with the instructors and others going through the workshop to show
progress and ask for help.

For each step there is a folder, eg the first step is `01-data/01-hello-world`.
`cd` into this folder, and follow run the commands from that folder.

You will be running `fpm serve` in each folder, so do remember to kill the fpm
server when you are done with a step and moving to another step.

Each step is organized as a series of tasks. Do give a shout out to everyone
when you are done with a task. Or feel free to ask for help in Chat or view
by speaking out during the workshop.

Have fun, you are among friends.

## Part 1: Working With Data In FTD

In this part we will install [fpm](https://fpm.dev), a learn about data
modelling capabilities of FTD.

- [Step 1: Hello World](01-data/01-hello-world/)
- [Step 2: Boolean Variables](01-data/02-boolean/)
- [Step 3: Numbers And Strings](01-data/03-numbers-and-strings/)
- [Step 4: Records](01-data/04-records/)

## Part 2: Building Reusable Server Side UI

In this part we will learn how to create re-usable UI components.


## Part 3: Front-end Event Handling And HTTP APIs

In this we will learn how to do event handling and to work with HTTP APIs.
