This repository contains the source code of a [FTD Hands-On
Workshop](https://ftd.dev/workshop/).

> FTD language is a possible replacement for JavaScript/React to build web
> front-ends. In this workshop you will learn the basics of FTD and build a web
> app that talks to existing web services. We will build an application for
> managing to-do lists from scratch.
>
> Basic knowledge of HTTP API is needed, but no prior knowledge of front-end is
> required.
>
> The workshop is taught by the creators of FTD, and you will learn about the
> motivation and design decisions that shaped FTD as well.
>
> In this hands-on workshop we will go through a series of exercises in stages
> and write code to get the application working. Participants are required to
> have a decent computer, but there is no need to install any software before
> hand (other than your favorite editor).

This workshop is a 3 part workshop, where in each part we will learn a different
aspect of programming with FTD. In first two parts we will interact with HTTP API
and create side data driven server rendered pages. In the third part we will
create client side event handling and interact with HTTP APIs (ajax and form
submissions).
