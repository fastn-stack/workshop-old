# Dark mode support

In the last exercise, we have get familiar with basic style, now we will see
how dark and light mode support works.

We have seen that to create a color, we use the `ftd.color` record which has
two fields, light and dark. The `light` field enables during system light mode
and `dark` field enables during system dark mode .

## Task: Fix FTD files

Go through [index.ftd](index.ftd) and fix them as per instructions given in the 
file.

Then change the system appearance settings to change the system mode i.e. `light` 
and `dark` and see the results for each mode.

## You Are Done

You have learnt how appearance works with ftd styling.
